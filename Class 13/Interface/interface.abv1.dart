// An interface is a contract that defines the capabilities of a class.
// Dart has no keyword interface, but you can use class or abstract class to declare an interface.
// Use abstract class to declare an interface.
// A class can extend only one class but can implement multiple interfaces.
// Using the interface, you can achieve multiple inheritance in Dart.
// It is used to achieve abstraction
// Most of the time, abstract class is used instead of concrete class to declare an interface.
// You must have override method and properties in implement class
